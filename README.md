# A Return to the Classics!

For many players, Minecraft has never felt the same as in its golden age. Back then, technology mods were simple, powerful, and fun to learn.

That philosophy has largely faded from modern modpacks—so Expocraft is here to bring it back.

# Main Features

The new **[1.1 “Badger” release](https://modrinth.com/modpack/expocraft/changelog)** for *Minecraft 1.21.1* overhauls the pack from the ground up:

* **Tech**: The Create ecosystem is gone, replaced by classics like **Applied Energistics 2** and **Ender IO**, alongside Sophisticated Storage and Backpacks.
* **Farming**: Instead of Croptopia, farming is now built around **Farmer’s Delight** and **Mystical Agriculture**, giving progression from simple crops to late-game resources.
* **World & Exploration**: Explore **Terralith** landscapes, YUNG’s reworked dungeons, and new village & pillager structures. The **Eternal Nether** adds more depth to the underworld.
* **Combat & Gear**: Better Combat, trinket slots via Accessories/Curios, new weapons, and Illager expansion mods shake up the adventure side.
* **Decoration & Atmosphere**: Expanded Macaw’s sets, Handcrafted, Chipped, Sound Physics, and AmbientSounds for immersive worlds and cozy builds.
* **Performance & QoL**: Sodium, Lithium, FerriteCore, ModernFix, and dynamic optimizations keep gameplay smooth. Xaero’s maps, Jade, REI, Serene Seasons, and FancyMenu improve usability and immersion.

In short: **a polished, modernized return to the classic “tech + farming + exploration” formula**.

# About the Philosophy

The 1.0 release was a stepping stone—ambitious, but closer to a mixed experiment. **1.1 “Badger” is the first true realization of Expocraft’s vision**: a carefully curated, performance-friendly, yet content-rich pack that feels like the modded classics of the past. Future updates will refine balance, resource pack support, and long-term progression even further.

# Closing Statement

I’ve been playing Minecraft since 2017–2018, and my love for older packs like Tekkit and SkyFactory inspired Expocraft. I’ve built and played many personal packs over the years, and while I don’t code, I hope this project lets others relive the magic of those golden-age experiences—updated for modern Minecraft.
