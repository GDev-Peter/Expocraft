## A Return to the Classics!

For many players, Minecraft has never felt the same as in its golden age. Back then, technology mods were cool, easy to use, and fun to learn.

That philosophy has mostly disappeared from modern modpacks, so here we are—trying to revive it.

## Main Features

The current [1.0 version](https://modrinth.com/modpack/expocraft/changelog) takes a complex approach to 1.20.1 modding, combining intricate world generation with plenty of structures. The main focus of this version, however, is farming, with the inclusion of two classic mods: Farmer’s Delight and Croptopia. For more details, check the changelog.

For future versions, we aim to bring the modpack to 1.21.1, which will make Croptopia and Create obsolete. This will require significant modifications. Expected changes include: new tech mods, revamped farming, and updated world generation.

| Modpack Version | Minecraft Version | Status         |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **1.0**         | **1.20.1**        | **Released**   |
| 1.1             | 1.21.1            | Planned        |

## About the Philosophy

The current 1.0 version still falls short of the ideal, old-school style of classic modpacks. Future updates aim to close that gap by refining mod selection and adding support for curated resource packs.

## Closing Statement

I, the author, have been playing Minecraft since 2017–2018 and really enjoyed older modpacks like Tekkit and SkyFactory. Over time, I’ve created personal modpacks and gained broad experience with many of them. Even though I don’t know how to code, I hope this project lets others relive the same experiences I once had years ago—this time in modern Minecraft.
